Version history for the MasterKey Widget Set (MKWS)

1.1.0  [IN PROGRESS]
	- Add a new Handlebars helper, mkws-if-either, which evaluates
	  two conditions and runs the bracketed template if either is
	  true. Astonishingly, there is no way to make such a check
	  using stock Handlebars.
	- Add another Handlebars helper, "compare". This code is by
	  Mike Griffin, taken from a blog comment (see source code for
	  details).
	- ### Check JIRA.
